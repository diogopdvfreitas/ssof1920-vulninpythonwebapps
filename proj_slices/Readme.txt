These example slices are provided with the aim of helping point out:

- possible ways in which programs can encode dependencies that you might be overlooking.
- that the analysis that your tool should perform is independent of the actual names of functions and variables and what are their perceived meaning or usage in real Python frameworks
- that the existence of a vulnerability or sanitization depends on whether and how function names appear in the vulnerability patterns, and in which positions

These examples will not be used in any automatic evaluation component of the grading.  They do however contain types of flows that will be considered in the evaluation, some of which are corner cases for distinguishing the highest grades.
